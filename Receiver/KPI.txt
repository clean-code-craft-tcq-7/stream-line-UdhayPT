Taking the Console Output

The Receiver

    reads the parameters from the console input
    after reading every parameter, it prints the following:
        maximum and minimum values in the incoming stream
        simple moving average of the last 5 values


Sample Console Output

Sending Battery Stream line parameters, BatteryLevel: 32.54538345336914%, Charging Current: 3.85644793510437 A
Sending Battery Stream line parameters, BatteryLevel: 62.93474578857422%, Charging Current: 2.315852642059326 A

Steps :

Using TDD to create the receiver as well, taking the Sample Console Output as example

First I shall Create a dummy console script which will simulate the Sample Console Sender Output
Then I should create a receiver script to pipe the sender console output in a stream
After that, we should try to add min and max of each value incoming
Then we are adding the simple moving average function
